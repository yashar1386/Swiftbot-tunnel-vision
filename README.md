# Swiftbot-tunnel-vision


Environmental Sensing: Utilized the SwiftBot's camera to process images and detect changes in average light intensity, signaling entry and exit from each tunnel.

Robot Calibration: Performed calibration tests to establish a relationship between the SwiftBot's speed units and the physical distance traveled. This allowed for accurate distance calculations despite the ambiguity of the robot's speed units.

Real-time Obstacle Detection: Implemented a failsafe feature to detect and respond to obstacles in the robot's path, taking a photo and terminating the program for safety.

Data Logging: The program automatically records key data points, including tunnel lengths and total distance traveled, to a log file for later analysis.

Command-Line Interface: The program is controlled via a user-friendly command-line interface, using the SwiftBot's buttons for specific commands.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code is structured using OOP principles to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable design.
